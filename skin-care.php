                Dermatologists advise Derma Pen, a type of micro-needling, for a variety of skin issues, including
                stretch marks, wrinkles, depressed acne scars, and surgical scarring. For safe, controlled therapy and
                improved results, the process uses small, sterile needles in a special, spring-loaded needle tip to
                create minute micro punctures on the skin. Collagen production is boosted by it. Your skin is left
                refreshed and spotless after the collagen breaks down the fibrous tissue and replaces it with regular
                tissue.

              <p>
                A novel method of treating scars, particularly acne scars, stretch marks, wrinkles, and facial
                rejuvenation is micro needling using derma roller. Derma roller treatment for acne scars is beneficial
                for those with minor scarring. A hand-held tool with tiny needles called a "derma roller" is used to
                treat acne scars. For maximum comfort, a topical numbing gel is given to the treatment region prior to
                beginning the operation. Derma roller for acne scars creates pores in the dermis during the operation,
                which promotes the release of cytokines and growth factors. Collagen, elastin, and neovascularization
                are stimulated by the growth factors and cytokines, which in turn cause a wound healing cascade. Our
                skin experts at Gandharva Wellness Studio recommends scheduling needling sessions in intervals. We add
                serums tailored to your skin issues to the treated region throughout the procedure: Hyaluronic acid,
                growth factors, and skin boosters are used to combat ageing; vitamin C serums and skin enhancers are
                used to rejuvenate and brighten the skin on the face; vitamin E and rosehip oils are used to treat
                stretch marks; (collagen and elastin containing serums for acne scars).

              <p>
                In a non-invasive process called micro needling, tiny needles are used to tighten the skin and remove
                fine lines and wrinkles. Without causing skin damage, the microneedle encourages collagen formation in
                the skin. When skin needling and PRP or vitamin C are used together, the results on acne scars are much
                better. The treatment is sometimes referred to as "collagen induction therapy" when micro needling and
                PRP are used together.

              <p>Sometimes scars from acne are left behind. The good news is that these scars can be covered up with
                fillers for those who are embarrassed by how they look.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dermal fillers are injected into the skin to lift acne scars that include depressions or to promote the
                skin's own collagen production.
              </p>
              <p>Hyaluronic acid fillers (such as Restylane and Juvederm) and autologous fat transfer, in which the
                patient's own fat is removed and injected into the acne scars, are two options for fillers.</p>

                The hollowness under the eyes that most Asian men and women develop provides the appearance of dark
                circles. Even after getting a full eight hours of sleep, this could make you look sluggish and dull.
                Even at the young age of 18, this may begin. There are a variety of causes, including heredity, familial
                factors, inadequate sleep, stress, eye strain from using high power glasses for an extended period of
                time, smoking, weight loss, and other factors. This can be fixed by using a Hyaluronic acid filler to
                hydrate the under-eye area, which produces immediate and satisfying effects. The face has an unforced
                freshness.

                Deep lines around the mouth and nose are caused by the skin sagging that occurs with age and
                particularly after childbearing. The lines that go from the corner of the lips to the side of the nose
                and from the corner of the lips to the deepest part of the chin give the face an older, harder
                appearance. By filling in these lines, one can transform a sad-looking face into one that is balanced,
                organically shaped, with a lifted face and delicate contours.

                The benefits of having a lovely face include having a flawless jawline and an extended chin. A square
                manly jaw for males or an oval-shaped face, which is said to be the most attractive for women, may both
                be created in an hour! With the right filler, you can get the ideal jaw and chin without undergoing any
                surgery.

                Glabellar lines (the lines between eyebrows) are eliminated with forehead contouring . To give the
                forehead a broader appearance, fillers smooth out the wrinkles and fine lines there. To reshape the nose
                to the ideal form, filler can also be used. The hollow on the sides of the forehead known as the
                "temples" is brought on by ageing or genetics. With a small amount of filler volume, the desired
                fullness and convexity of the forehead can be attained.

                Imagine your own blood giving your facial skin a fresh start! The most natural way to improve skin
                texture, cure scars, stop the ageing process, and revitalise the skin is with a vampire facial. A
                person's own blood is utilised to extract growth factors that are then used to encourage the production
                of collagen and skin renewal.

                Anti-wrinkle injections can be used to eliminate unsightly lines around the eyes and the persistent
                horizontal and vertical ridges on the forehead. We employ Botulinum toxin, a neurotoxic protein that
                relaxes muscles and stops the skin from wrinkling. It effectively reduces facial expression lines like
                crow's feet around the eyes, frown and surprise lines on the forehead, and turkey-neck lines on the
                throat. A growing number of people are using the therapy, and some even use it as a preventative
                measure. </p>

                A Vampire Facial is actually a type of PRP that was created to address scars, hyperpigmentation, and
                skin conditions associated with ageing. Platelet Rich Plasms, or PRP, were first used to treat pain,
                arthritis, and other bodily problems. The technique reinjected platelets into the area of concern where
                there was injured tissue using platelets from the patient's own blood.
