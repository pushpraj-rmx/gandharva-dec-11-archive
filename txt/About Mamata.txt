About Mamta Verma
______________________________________________

Mamta Verma's aspirations, which were the foundation of Gandharva Wellness Studio, have come to fruition. After working in the wellness craft for over 25 years, she began to understand that ultimate health cannot be attained just by putting emphasis on the physical body. This realization of maintaining one's emotional and mental health was the turning point which pursuaded her to take the trip to connect with her own self. She ended up visiting Bagan, Stonehenge, monasteries in Ladakh, pilgrimage sites like Amarnath, and Orkney and Shetland in Scotland as a result of it.
The sheer feeling of serenity and peace was something fresh and unusual that her voyage had brought out in her. This further persuaded her to offer services and therapeutic treatments to improve the wellness of the coterie.

Due to the steadfast support and direction of Saurabh Chauhan (business partner), a fitness enthusiast and spiritual person in his own right, Gandharva came into existence. His very stated commercial acumen gives the entire paradigm of this well-being model an edge.
