Beauty Essentials

Threading
Most young women were introduced to the salon with the need to thread their eyebrows, chin, upper lip and so on. Even though it is one of the most basic of the salon services, we tend to stick to the same staff who we’ve been going to for years. At Gandharva Wellness every staff is trained and experienced to do the very basic yet very significant service!

Waxing
The days of excruciating waxing are long gone! At Gandharva Wellness Studio, we strive to make the waxing process as easy as possible. You can select the standard Honey wax or any flavour from our selection of premium waxes. The final outcome will be smooth and long-lasting if these fragrant waxes are selected depending on the particular skin types.

Bleach
Everyone desires skin that is perfect, radiant, and looks brighter. Everyone wants to look beautiful and bright, so they bleach their skin to remove dark spots, dead skin cells, skin tan, sun damage, dark patches, and skin pigmentation in order to achieve lighter, even, smoother, and fairer looking skin, whether they are attending a family party, a night out with friends, a college event, a date, or a wedding ceremony. But many of us are still wary because we believe it would be harsh on our skin. Gandharva Wellness's experts recommend skin-friendly products with no side effects.

Now say goodbye to uneven skin tone with our special selection of bleaches, which range from mild Protein de-tan to extremely potent Simple de-tan.

1 Hot Oil Manicure
The hot oil manicure is the best thing one can do for dry hands because it is arguably the most luxurious and soothing of them all. It is obvious that dipping the fingers in hot natural oils is the nicest aspect of this manicure.

Isn't the ideal manicure a sumptuous hand massage using a specially formulated natural oil combination that leaves your fingers and cuticles well-moisturized and nourished?

2. Salon pedicure

The fact that a spa manicure offers so much more than a standard manicure explains why it is popular with millennials.

Because it contains an aromatic salt scrub, an oil massage, and a nourishing mask on the hands and around the nails, this manicure lasts longer.

3. Soak-Off Gel manicure

In soak-off manicures, the soak-off gel polish is painted on, and each layer is dried with UV light before being followed by another.

These gels come in a wide range of colours, dry quickly, and last on your nails for around two to three weeks.

4. Paraffin Wax Manicure 

This one is well-liked among our clientele because it is a reliable stress reliever. For the paraffin wax manicure, you must first wrap your hands in clean towels after soaking them for a while in lukewarm liquid wax (palm to wrist).

5. 3 D Manicure 
If you consider yourself to be simply far ahead of the curve and believe that French manicures are no longer appropriate for you, the 3D manicure can help you step up your nail game. You begin by putting acrylic to some false nails and painting them the colour of your choice. You then place the acrylic-coated fake nails onto your natural nails and start adding small accents to make a pretty design. If you want to go all out, you can add some rhinestones to your nails, or if you want something more feminine, consider pearls or petals.

6. Acrylic Manicure

To ensure that your actual nail polish is applied as smoothly as possible, it essentially serves as a basis. It can be quickly removed, is long-lasting, and is easily fixable. What more could a manicure possibly offer?

Pedicures
You can take care of your looks, health, and freshness in a variety of ways. A pedicure is typically performed to relax your entire body and to relieve stress in addition to serving utilitarian purposes. To provide a relaxing and refreshing experience, Gandharva Wellness Studio provides a variety of pedicures, including:
___________________

1 Standard Pedicure :
The most popular foot maintenance technique is the standard pedicure. You first let your skin swell by soaking your feet in warm water. You scrub off pollutants and dead skin after soaking. Nail trimming, nail development, and nail skin removal follow. If this operation is being done in a spa, you can also have a soothing foot massage with moisturising cream.

2 French pedicure, second:

Women love getting their feet done in this particular way. Up until the application of nail polish, the entire procedure is the same as in a standard pedicure. Transparent base polish is initially applied to the nails. White nail polish is used to polish the nail's tip. It mimics the natural structure and shape of a nail.

3. Gel Pedicure 

For those who want to enjoy a good pedicure and polish for a longer period of time, there is a special form of pedicure. Up until the point of applying nail polish, the entire procedure is identical to a standard pedicure. UV rays are used to treat applied nail polish. This procedure needs to be repeated several times. Most likely three times, to be exact. For up to four weeks, this polish will stay on your nails.
______________________
4. Paraffin Bath Procedure 

A paraffin bath will help if the skin on your feet is dry and cracked. Your feet are placed into warm paraffin during the treatment. Paraffin softens, hydrates, and helps to open skin pores on your foot. The procedure is ideal for someone who wants soft, younger-looking feet.
____________________________
5. Mini Pedicure 

The standard pedicure has been condensed into the mini pedicure. You get your feet washed, nails cut, and shaped during mini pedicures. This pedicure is intended for sensible folks who simply want to have their feet taken care of and want to save time and money.

6. Spa Pedicure :

The conventional pedicure has been upgraded by the SPA pedicure. You will experience these relaxing feelings while having a pedicure at a spa:

1. Feet soaking and scrubbing

2. Traditional foot massage and pedicure using nourishing and aromatherapy oils.
________________

7. Waterless Pedicure 

Instead of using water for this pedicure, you use a disinfecting spray. Warm towels are wrapped around the sprayed feet and left on them for a while. Wrapped feet take a soak in the mist. They swell even with little liquid present. Everything continues as it would in a standard pedicure after that. This form of pedicure is common in areas where access to water, or more accurately, a lack thereof, is a problem.

8. Athletic / Sports Pedicure 

This pedicure is intended for a person who participates in an active sport and whose feet are sore from repeated exercise. Warm water and skin lotion are applied to the feet as they are being treated. The application of cooling aromatics to assist relieve aching, fatigued muscles gives this form of pedicure a minor twist from the traditional pedicure. Peppermint, eucalyptus, and/or cucumber scents are frequently present. The best part is a delightful and soothing foot massage, which helps your tired feet regain vitality.

9. Rose pedicure

You cover your feet in rose petals before soaking them in warm water to begin the treatment. The same rose petals are used to scrub feet once they have been thoroughly moistened. Following this, the procedure is the same as for a standard pedicure: cream, polish, possible massage, nail trimming and forming.
