DeTan Cleanup
Pollution, UV rays from the sun, and our poor lifestyle choices can all contribute to tanning. Almost everyone wonders how to get rid of that pesky tan. Many root for Gandharva detan services. It not only removes tan but also helps to restore the natural glow from within. Gandharva uses detan, a unique blend of natural and new age components combined with various fruits/vegetable extracts and essential oils.

Helps to slough off dead skin cells, allowing the tan to disappear while keeping the skin supple and hydrated. It gives the skin cellular protection as well as a young glow. It brightens, lightens, and evens out skin that is drab, spotty, or damaged.
