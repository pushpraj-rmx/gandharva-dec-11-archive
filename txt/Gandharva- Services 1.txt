Sound Healing 

For hundreds of years, people from many different cultures have utilised sound therapy to improve their physical, mental, and spiritual health. The parasympathetic nervous system is rejuvenated by the complex, profoundly penetrating sound waves produced by the antique gong and Tibetan bowls. Deep relaxation and healing occur as a result of the listener being coaxed into an instantaneous theta stage of meditative REM.

Past Life Regression

The goal of past life regression is to retrieve what practitioners believe to be memories of previous incarnations or lifetimes through hypnosis. Regression to a past life is frequently done in a psychotherapy environment or in quest of a mystical connection. In order to prevent you from entering a full trance and allow you to recall some of the regression, Gandharva's past life regression session begins with a preparatory discussion and is followed by a tranquil meditation.
