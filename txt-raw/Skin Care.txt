Chemical Peels

Numerous natural items are used in India as part of traditional home remedies to maintain good skin. Lemon juice, which is high in citric acid, is applied to the face. Similar to this, curcumin-containing turmeric is applied for skin that is more radiant and brighter. Additionally, milk, a strong source of lactic acid, is recommended for healthy-looking skin. These are all gifts from nature that offer wonderful natural ingredients that are good for the skin.


Chemical peels are simply these natural extracts and active substances in a more potent concentrated form. In order to cure specific acne, pigmentation, and to obtain the finest skin health, such concentrates are derived from the best organic sources in their purest form. Dermatologists apply these concentrates to the skin.

Micro needling- DERMAPEN
Dermatologists advise Derma Pen, a type of micro-needling, for a variety of skin issues, including stretch marks, wrinkles, depressed acne scars, and surgical scarring. For safe, controlled therapy and improved results, the process uses small, sterile needles in a special, spring-loaded needle tip to create minute micro punctures on the skin. Collagen production is boosted by it. Your skin is left refreshed and spotless after the collagen breaks down the fibrous tissue and replaces it with regular tissue.

Micro needling - Derma roller
A novel method of treating scars, particularly acne scars, stretch marks, wrinkles, and facial rejuvenation is micro needling using derma roller. Derma roller treatment for acne scars is beneficial for those with minor scarring. A hand-held tool with tiny needles called a "derma roller" is used to treat acne scars. For maximum comfort, a topical numbing gel is given to the treatment region prior to beginning the operation. Derma roller for acne scars creates pores in the dermis during the operation, which promotes the release of cytokines and growth factors. Collagen, elastin, and neovascularization are stimulated by the growth factors and cytokines, which in turn cause a wound healing cascade. Our skin experts at Gandharva Wellness Studio recommends scheduling needling sessions in intervals. We add serums tailored to your skin issues to the treated region throughout the procedure: Hyaluronic acid, growth factors, and skin boosters are used to combat ageing; vitamin C serums and skin enhancers are used to rejuvenate and brighten the skin on the face; vitamin E and rosehip oils are used to treat stretch marks; (collagen and elastin containing serums for acne scars).

MICRONEEDLING PRP.
In a non-invasive process called micro needling, tiny needles are used to tighten the skin and remove fine lines and wrinkles. Without causing skin damage, the microneedle encourages collagen formation in the skin. When skin needling and PRP or vitamin C are used together, the results on acne scars are much better. The treatment is sometimes referred to as "collagen induction therapy" when micro needling and PRP are used together.

***** Repeted title** continuation
Sometimes scars from acne are left behind. The good news is that these scars can be covered up with fillers for those who are embarrassed by how they look.

Dermal fillers are injected into the skin to lift acne scars that include depressions or to promote the skin's own collagen production.
Hyaluronic acid fillers (such as Restylane and Juvederm) and autologous fat transfer, in which the patient's own fat is removed and injected into the acne scars, are two options for fillers.

Fillers
Fillers are a gift from science that improve the grace and beauty of your face by enhancing its aesthetic appeal and symmetry while harmonising its outward features.

Hyaluronic acid fillers are a gel-like substance that hydrate, volumize, and re-contour the face to give it a naturally appealing appearance. A hygroscopic substance called hyaluronic acid stores moisture in the skin and keeps it moisturised.

Cheek contouring face lift
As we age, our skin loses elasticity, causing drooping and flattening of the cheeks. To get that bigger cheek and improve the cheek shape, filler is employed. It instantly lifts the face, making it look more youthful.

Undereye bag and Dark circle
The hollowness under the eyes that most Asian men and women develop provides the appearance of dark circles. Even after getting a full eight hours of sleep, this could make you look sluggish and dull. Even at the young age of 18, this may begin. There are a variety of causes, including heredity, familial factors, inadequate sleep, stress, eye strain from using high power glasses for an extended period of time, smoking, weight loss, and other factors. This can be fixed by using a Hyaluronic acid filler to hydrate the under-eye area, which produces immediate and satisfying effects. The face has an unforced freshness.

Lip Augmentation
The latest trend is fuller lips! There is no longer any justification to avoid having the ideal lips, regardless of whether your weakness is the cupid's bow or the lip margins. In order to achieve bigger lips and lips that are perfectly shaped to complement the individual's facial structure and features, fillers are administered.

Nasolabial fold and Marionette lines
Deep lines around the mouth and nose are caused by the skin sagging that occurs with age and particularly after childbearing. The lines that go from the corner of the lips to the side of the nose and from the corner of the lips to the deepest part of the chin give the face an older, harder appearance. By filling in these lines, one can transform a sad-looking face into one that is balanced, organically shaped, with a lifted face and delicate contours.

The benefits of having a lovely face include having a flawless jawline and an extended chin. A square manly jaw for males or an oval-shaped face, which is said to be the most attractive for women, may both be created in an hour!

Temples, Nose and Forehead shaping
Glabellar lines (the lines between eyebrows) are eliminated with forehead contouring . To give the forehead a broader appearance, fillers smooth out the wrinkles and fine lines there. To reshape the nose to the ideal form, filler can also be used. The hollow on the sides of the forehead known as the "temples" is brought on by ageing or genetics. With a small amount of filler volume, the desired fullness and convexity of the forehead can be attained.

PRP - FACE COLLAGEN THERAPY
Imagine your own blood giving your facial skin a fresh start! The most natural way to improve skin texture, cure scars, stop the ageing process, and revitalise the skin is with a vampire facial.

ANTI WRINKLE PROCEDURE
Anti-wrinkle injections can be used to eliminate unsightly lines around the eyes and the persistent horizontal and vertical ridges on the forehead. We employ Botulinum toxin, a neurotoxic protein that relaxes muscles and stops the skin from wrinkling. It effectively reduces facial expression lines like crow's feet around the eyes, frown and surprise lines on the forehead, and turkey-neck lines on the throat. A growing number of people are using the therapy, and some even use it as a preventative measure.

The Vampire Facial / PRP
A Vampire Facial is actually a type of PRP that was created to address scars, hyperpigmentation, and skin conditions associated with ageing. Platelet Rich Plasms, or PRP, were first used to treat pain, arthritis, and other bodily problems. The technique reinjected platelets into the area of concern where there was injured tissue using platelets from the patient's own blood.
