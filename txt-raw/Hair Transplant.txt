What is It?
It involves cosmetic surgery. The FUE (Follicular Unit Extraction) technique can also be used to transplant eyebrows, beards, and moustaches. It is a permanent way of implanting a patient's own natural hair from the back of the head (donor area) to the bald part of the head (receiver area).

In its most basic form, hair transplant surgery involves removing hair from the donor area in the back of your head, where the hair is genetically predisposed to grow for the rest of your life, and transplanting it into balding and thinning areas of your scalp. A surgical procedure called Advanced Hair Transplant is carried out under local anesthesia.Your hair loss stage, your goals, and your expectations are carefully taken into account as our specialists prepare the operation in advance. At Gandharva, we provide both FUE (Follicular Unit Extraction) and FUT Strip Transplant hair transplant operations. Based on your age and the density of your donor region hair, among other things, our doctors will recommend and carry out the procedure that is optimal for you.

Treatment at Gandharva

* Prior to hair transplant, blood testing, trichoscopic analyses, and folliscopy tests are performed.

* The most cutting-edge method of hair transplantation that we use is called "Bio FUE" (follicular unit extraction method or Direct Hair Implant).

* The scalp will be numbed by the surgeon while the patient is under local anaesthesia. The surgeon will then make slits to give the hair the right depth, angle, and direction.

* Then, using specialised forceps, hair is transplanted into the recipient area from micro-grafts (a group of 2â€“5 hair follicles). Plastic surgeons with extensive training carry out the treatments. The best approach for achieving results is risk-free and produces organic outcomes.

* The procedure lasts roughly 6-7 hours, with 2-3 breaks in between. The patient is fully cognizant throughout. Following the procedure, the patient returns home the same day. Three days later, they are contacted to remove the bandage and have their first head wash performed in the clinic.

* A follow-up is conducted every month apart. The third month marks the beginning of hair growth, while the final six to nine months mark full growth.

* The quantity of grafts used to completely cover the bald area will determine the cost of the hair transplant. In rare circumstances, hair can be transplanted without trimming the whole hair also.

* The patient's desired hairline is marked. A FUE machine is used to harvest grafts from the donor area. It contains a tiny punch that can pull hair up to 0.7 mm in diameter.
