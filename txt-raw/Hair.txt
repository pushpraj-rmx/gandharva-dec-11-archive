Mesotherapy for hair
At Gandharva Wellness Studio Vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, growth factors, and hair peptides are delivered via a non-injectable approach that deeply penetrates the hair roots to strengthen and hydrate them. The use of radiofrequency in mesotherapy helps the meso solution properly penetrate deeply into the roots and is a painless and needle-free way to rapidly reverse hair loss.

Mesotherapy
It is a spa for the roots of your hair. Mesotherapy, a procedure carried out in a dermatology clinic, nourishes the roots of the hair, giving them power and deep nourishment, in contrast to salon hair spas that nourish the length of the hair, making them soft and shiny.
It is mostly used as a hair loss therapy. A radiofrequency-activated peptide serum rich in vitamins and growth factors is sprayed into the scalp, where it is then absorbed by each and every hair follicle. In order to strengthen the hair roots, it is occasionally also injectable, involving the superficial injection of serum into the scalp.
The scalp is treated with a serum containing the vitamins, minerals, hair peptides, and antioxidants needed to strengthen the hair roots, which is then followed by a soothing electroporation technique. Thus, the serum is infused into the hair roots and the blood flow to the scalp is increased, allowing the beneficial nutrients to penetrate the hair roots.
It is a remarkable nutrient therapy for the hair roots that stops hair loss in three sessions. By providing nutrition to the hair, this strengthens the roots of the hair.

Hair Growth Factor Therapy
a very effective hair treatment that uses concentrated growth factors that are taken from the patient's own blood.
It has a long-lasting effect on hair and skin which  eliminates dandruff, reduces hair loss, increases hair thickness and volume, and hides scalp bald spots. It is a completely risk-free, non-surgical procedure with no adverse effects.
Our blood contains a variety of cells, including fibroblasts and other powerful cells like A cells. These cells are capable of renewing the hair cells by creating new cells and fibers in place of worn-out ones.


Treatment at Gandharva
Complete scalp inspection with several tests is only done in the clinic.
An experienced trichologist makes an accurate diagnosis of the causes of hair loss and plans the appropriate course of action.
For those with a significant family history of hair loss, one treatment per month is recommended for 3-6 sessions, depending on the degree of hair loss.
To maintain hair growth, maintenance sessions are advised every three months. For this therapy to be effective, it's crucial to monitor blood levels of vitamins and ferritin. Since the patient's own blood is utilised to stimulate hair growth, there are no negative effects and minimal local anaesthesia is used.
There is no downtime during its 1-2 hour length. Thus, the patient can immediately return to work.

The patient's own blood is drawn, and using centrifugation, the serum is separated from the blood. To extract the growth factors, a growth factor-releasing solution is used on the collected serum. When applied to the scalp, the serum, which is rich in the growth factors fibroblast and A cells, stimulates the development of new hair follicles, enhances the quality of existing hair, and prevents hair loss.
