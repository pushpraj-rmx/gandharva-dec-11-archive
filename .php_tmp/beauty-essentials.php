                staff who we’ve been going to for years. At Gandharva Wellness every staff is trained and experienced to
                do the very basic yet very significant service!

                are selected depending on the particular skin types.

                Everyone desires skin that is perfect, radiant, and looks brighter. Everyone wants to look beautiful and
                bright, so they bleach their skin to remove dark spots, dead skin cells, skin tan, sun damage, dark
                patches, and skin pigmentation in order to achieve lighter, even, smoother, and fairer looking skin,
                whether they are attending a family party, a night out with friends, a college event, a date, or a
                wedding ceremony. But many of us are still wary because we believe it would be harsh on our skin.
                Gandharva Wellness's experts recommend skin-friendly products with no side effects.
                <br>
                Now say goodbye to uneven skin tone with our special selection of bleaches, which range from mild
                Protein de-tan to extremely potent Simple de-tan.

                skin types, including fruit, anti-tan, skin purifying, and many more. Our face packs are loaded with

                If you consider yourself to be simply far ahead of the curve and believe that French manicures are no
                longer appropriate for you, the 3D manicure can help you step up your nail game. You begin by putting
                acrylic to some false nails and painting them the colour of your choice. You then place the
                acrylic-coated fake nails onto your natural nails and start adding small accents to make a pretty
                design. If you want to go all out, you can add some rhinestones to your nails, or if you want something
                more feminine, consider pearls or petals.

              <p>To ensure that your actual nail polish is applied as smoothly as possible, it essentially serves as a
                basis. It can be quickly removed, is long-lasting, and is easily fixable. What more could a manicure
                possibly offer?
                You don't need to worry about it anymore because the 3D manicure will up your nail game. You begin by

              performed to relax your entire body and to relieve stress in addition to serving utilitarian purposes. To
              provide a relaxing and refreshing experience, Gandharva Wellness Studio provides a variety of pedicures,

              <p>
                The most popular foot maintenance technique is the standard pedicure. You first let your skin swell by
                soaking your feet in warm water. You scrub off pollutants and dead skin after soaking. Nail trimming,
                nail development, and nail skin removal follow. If this operation is being done in a spa, you can also
                have a soothing foot massage with moisturising cream.

                Women love getting their feet done in this particular way. Up until the application of nail polish, the
                entire procedure is the same as in a standard pedicure. Transparent base polish is initially applied to
                the nails. White nail polish is used to polish the nail's tip. It mimics the natural structure and shape
                of a nail.</p>

                For those who want to enjoy a good pedicure and polish for a longer period of time, there is a special
                form of pedicure. Up until the point of applying nail polish, the entire procedure is identical to a
                standard pedicure. UV rays are used to treat applied nail polish. This procedure needs to be repeated
                several times. Most likely three times, to be exact. For up to four weeks, this polish will stay on your
                nails.

                A paraffin bath will help if the skin on your feet is dry and cracked. Your feet are placed into warm
                paraffin during the treatment. Paraffin softens, hydrates, and helps to open skin pores on your foot.
                The procedure is ideal for someone who wants soft, younger-looking feet.</p>

                The standard pedicure has been condensed into the mini pedicure. You get your feet washed, nails cut,

                their feet taken care of and want to save time and money.

                Instead of using water for this pedicure, you use a disinfecting spray. Warm towels are wrapped around
                the sprayed feet and left on them for a while. Wrapped feet take a soak in the mist. They swell even
                with little liquid present. Everything continues as it would in a standard pedicure after that. This
                form of pedicure is common in areas where access to water, or more accurately, a lack thereof, is a
                problem.

                This pedicure is intended for a person who participates in an active sport and whose feet are sore from
                repeated exercise. Warm water and skin lotion are applied to the feet as they are being treated. The
                application of cooling aromatics to assist relieve aching, fatigued muscles gives this form of pedicure
                a minor twist from the traditional pedicure. Peppermint, eucalyptus, and/or cucumber scents are
                frequently present. The best part is a delightful and soothing foot massage, which helps your tired feet
                regain vitality.

                You cover your feet in rose petals before soaking them in warm water to begin the treatment. The same
                rose petals are used to scrub feet once they have been thoroughly moistened. Following this, the
                procedure is the same as for a standard pedicure: cream, polish, possible massage, nail trimming and
                forming.
