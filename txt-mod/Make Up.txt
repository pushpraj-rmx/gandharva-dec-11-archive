Party Makeup
Are you undecided about your next look? Gandharva's team will assist you in achieving the overall aesthetic you desire. Our expert hair and make-up artists will begin by asking you a few questions about the event, mood, time, and general vibe, as well as your expectations. The crew will customise and hand build the ideal make up look for you based on your clothes, making you look "Effortlessly Awsome."

We offer everything from a nude, make-up-free look to a princess-like diva look for a cocktail function.

Get the right look for a daytime event with light makeup with a twist or a dewy complexion. Our expert painters will apply a light subtle foundation and a soft pastel eye shadow, ideally in pastel tones.

If you're heading out for an evening with your pals or maybe a date with your beloved, Smokey Eyes is your go-to, since it perfectly complements the event. A dab of red lipstick on the ideal pout will complete and balance the entire appearance, and we will further redefine with a touch up of a metallic lip gloss or the ombre effect, which will provide the much needed "Oomph factor" and bring out your wonderful self! And the actress within you!

What else? All of our party dresses are not only stunning but also quite affordable. So block the dates on your party Calendar at Gandharva!
